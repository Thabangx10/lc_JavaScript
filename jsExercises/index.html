    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
        1. Variable:<br><br> It is a container of values which can be stored in various ways to hold our data.<br><br>
        2. Value <br><br> It is information stored in an variable/ array. They can be found in objects as attributes to their respective keys. <br><br>
        3. Data type <br><br> Is self explanatory, but in my understanding, its describes what type of data is being held e.g string, number etc <br><br>
        4. Initialization <br><br> It is when we assign our variable name with a variable name e.g let fullName = 'Thabang Kganana'<br><br>
        5. Tell me the difference between let, var, and const. <br><br><strong>LET</strong> = if you don't want it, let is the keyword for you.<br><br><strong>VAR</strong> = If you want to reassign values: and you want the hoisting behavior, var is the keyword to use.<br><br><strong>CONST</strong> = If you never want a variable to change, const is the keyword to use.<br><br>
        6. What is a variable scope? <br><br> We have <strong>Global variables</strong> which can be called anywhere in our JS code and <strong>Local variable</strong> can only be called within the function where it has been defined. <br><br>
        7. When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach and do while loop? <br><br><strong>FOR</strong> = to iterate through an array and loop over a number of times. <br><br><strong>WHILE</strong> = when working with user input and icrementing until something is not true. <br><br>
        8. Define hoisting and variable scoping? <br><br> No matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
